# TarViz
Visualization dashboard for TarGene results

## Development from Eddie

In order to forward and display the the app in the browser (workaround taken from the [jupyther notebook config](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/remote-jupyter-notebook/)):

1. Create a SSH tunnel from your local machine:

```bash
ssh -fNL 9999:localhost:9999 wild-kb
```

or

```
ssh -fN s2042526@node2c17 -J s2042526@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk -L 9999:localhost:9999 
```
where wild-kb is the node where the app will be running and is described in the ssh config file.

2. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run 0_ðŸŒ¶_Home.py --server.port=9999 NEXTFLOW_RUNDIR
```

where `NEXTFLOW_RUNDIR` is the TarGene pipeline's run directory.
